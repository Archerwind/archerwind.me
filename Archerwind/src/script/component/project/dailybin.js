                  <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                  <p>In 21 century, environmental problems become more and more popular and lots of people are coming out serveral ways to make our earth better. I want to have some contribution to our planet as well. Find a way to drive people's awareness of how they injure the environment. Even it's simple.</p>
                </div>
                <div className="content-section">
                  <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                  <p>The answer should be very simple and easy to use to pervade everyone's life. Dailybin is an app to let people collect their gargage virtually when they throw things away. The app will show the statistic numbers and tell people how much hurt our environment. Then bring their awareness to donate.</p>

                  <h3>DIFFICULTY</h3>
                  <p>The biggest problem is the user experience design on the way that people throw trashes. No one would throw and open their smart phone to do such thing. So the design should be work with wearable devices and the trash can be recorded with a twist of people's arm. That was a great experience on user testing.</p>

                  San Francisco, the city where I live, is an amazing city that has the highest trash conversion rate in the world. And that reminds me of the damage we give to the earth. I want to create an app can drive peopleâ€™s awareness of how much they hurt the planet. The app have to be opened several times per day and teach people about the knowledge of how to protect the environment and do something more than that.

People can ust talk to siri to collect a kind of trash that I list in the app. Fast and easy.</div>
